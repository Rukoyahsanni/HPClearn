# ‚úÖ High Performance Computing (HPC) Learning Roadmap
**Duration:** 3 Months  
**Goal:** Learn and apply HPC concepts with real-world, cloud-based, and geoscience workloads  
**Weekly Commitment:** 6‚Äì12 hours

---

## üìÖ Month 1: Foundations & Linux Fluency

### Week 1‚Äì2
- [ ] Watch ‚ÄúIntro to High Performance Computing‚Äù (Coursera or YouTube)
- [ ] Understand key HPC terms: clusters, nodes, CPUs, interconnects
- [ ] Install Ubuntu (VM or WSL) and set up terminal environment
- [ ] Practice Linux commands: `ls`, `cd`, `grep`, `chmod`, `top`, `kill`, etc.
- [ ] Write simple Bash scripts with loops, variables, and functions

### Week 3‚Äì4
- [ ] Explore Linux file system (`/proc/`, `/etc/`, `/home/`)
- [ ] Automate jobs using `cron` or `at`
- [ ] Learn resource management basics: CPU, memory, I/O
- [ ] Read about HPC in geoscience (seismic imaging, CCUS)

---

## üìÖ Month 2: Parallel Computing & Job Scheduling

### Week 5‚Äì6
- [ ] Install and complete [MPI Tutorial](https://mpitutorial.com/)
- [ ] Write and run MPI ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù locally or in Docker
- [ ] Learn shared vs distributed memory: OpenMP vs MPI
- [ ] Build a basic matrix multiplication with MPI

### Week 7‚Äì8
- [ ] Learn SLURM: `sbatch`, `srun`, `squeue`, `scancel`, `sinfo`
- [ ] Write SLURM scripts to submit jobs
- [ ] Run job arrays and test job dependencies
- [ ] Explore SLURM simulators or Open OnDemand portals

---

## üìÖ Month 3: Cloud HPC & Real-World Applications

### Week 9‚Äì10
- [ ] Learn how HPC works in the cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- [ ] Launch a cluster with AWS ParallelCluster
- [ ] Scale the cluster (add/remove compute nodes)
- [ ] Run parallel jobs on cloud using SLURM or MPI

### Week 11‚Äì12
- [ ] Try open-source geoscience tools (e.g. Madagascar, SEISAN)
- [ ] Learn about HPC storage: Lustre, EBS, S3, HDF5
- [ ] Monitor job metrics and performance
- [ ] Join HPC communities (Reddit, HPC Slack, mailing lists)

---

## üß† Bonus (Optional)
- [ ] Learn Python multiprocessing and Dask
- [ ] Run GPU-based ML tasks on cloud HPC clusters
- [ ] Try containerization: Docker vs Singularity in HPC
- [ ] Contribute to open-source HPC projects or docs
